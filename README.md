# go-cli-todos
Todo app for the command line

## Initial Idea
Initialize a todo project like you would a git project: `project init`. The project locations are tracked in a dot-file in your home directory. The data for the project is stored in a dot-file in the directory of your choice. Each initialized directory (with a new dot-file) allows for a new project to be tracked on it's own. The project data could also be a part of your git project. Each todo may need to be it's own file to help prevent merge conflicts.
